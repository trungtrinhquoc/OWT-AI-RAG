       "AIMessage(content='The Dragon Bridge in Da Nang is famous for breathing fire and water every weekend. But what most tourists don\\'t know is the legend of Ông Rồng, the mischievous dragon spirit said to inhabit its steel belly.\\n\\nLocals whisper that Ông Rồng, weary of his monotonous performance, occasionally decides to spice things up. He\\'s not malicious, just…bored.\\n\\nOne sweltering Saturday night, instead of a predictable burst of flames, a cascade of shimmering, rainbow-colored bubbles erupted from the dragon\\'s mouth. The crowd gasped, then erupted in laughter. Children chased the bubbles, their parents snapping pictures, and even the stoic street vendors cracked smiles.\\n\\nThe next week, the fire was replaced with a downpour of fragrant jasmine water, drenching unsuspecting onlookers in a sweet, floral mist. Some were annoyed, but most found it hilarious, buying extra water bottles to refill and splash each other.\\n\\nThen came the week of the singing dragon. Instead of fire, the dragon emitted a series of off-key, yet strangely catchy, Vietnamese folk songs. The sound system, of course, malfunctioned, but everyone knew it was Ông Rồng. He even seemed to be improvising, adding in snippets of pop songs and even a distorted rendition of \"Happy Birthday\" for a tourist wearing a birthday hat.\\n\\nThe city authorities, naturally, were baffled. Engineers checked the mechanisms, programmers combed through the code, but everything seemed perfectly normal. They even consulted with a local geomancer, who, after examining the bridge and muttering incantations, simply shrugged and said, \"Ông Rồng is restless. Give him offerings of sticky rice and he might behave.\"\\n\\nSo, the city held a small, impromptu festival near the bridge, offering mountains of sticky rice and praying for Ông Rồng\\'s contentment. \\n\\nThe following Saturday, the dragon breathed fire and water as usual. However, as the last jet of water sputtered out, a single, perfectly formed sticky rice ball plopped onto the head of the chief engineer, who, covered in soot and water, could only laugh.\\n\\nFrom then on, the locals knew that Ông Rồng was still there, watching over Da Nang, adding a touch of unexpected magic to the mundane, and reminding everyone not to take themselves too seriously. And every Saturday night, before the dragon breathes, some locals still discreetly leave a small offering of sticky rice at the base of the bridge, just in case. They never know what Ông Rồng might do next.', additional_kwargs={}, response_metadata={'prompt_feedback': {'block_reason': 0, 'safety_ratings': []}, 'finish_reason': 'STOP', 'model_name': 'gemini-2.0-flash', 'safety_ratings': []}, id='run--2a69aaa2-b7de-46b5-b23b-71c22f371c9a-0', usage_metadata={'input_tokens': 10, 'output_tokens': 515, 'total_tokens': 525, 'input_token_details': {'cache_read': 0}})"
